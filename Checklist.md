# Coffee Hall of Fame Travel Checklist

Travel checklist for fellow coffeemaniacs. To qualify, a place must be the origin of a particular coffee drink and said drink must be available there today.

Here, _coffee drink_ means either a method of brewing coffee (Moka pot, espresso machine, etc.) or a particular mixture of drinks one of which is coffee. If there is any ambiguity to what _origin_ is, use the place where this drink was first served commercially in an establishment open to the public.

This list is incomplete. Feel free to expand the list and send a pull request. Feel free to expand the list by inventing new coffee drinks.
